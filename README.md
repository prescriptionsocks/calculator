This is a basic calculator built in JS.

The calc handles addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. As a basic calc, it does not follow the correct order of math operation but will rather calculate in pairs ie 1+2+3 will be handles as (1+2)+3.

The mini-project is part of The Odin Project online course.
